A modern, feature-rich Lovelace card for [Frigate NVR](https://frigate.video) in Home Assistant.

## Features

- **Live stream**: native player controls (play, mute, volume, fullscreen), with optional low-latency go2rtc streaming
- **Multi-camera grid**: any number of cameras, with a configurable column count; tap a camera to open it, or go fullscreen for a wall view
- **Timeline**: visual recording + event timeline, click to seek, drag to pan
- **Event tabs**: Clips · Snapshots · Recordings · Reviews · Kept (favourites)
- **Recording viewer**: custom playback controls with correct clip duration, seek bar, download-from-position
- **Reviews**: alert/detection severity, mark-reviewed, hide-reviewed filter
- **Clip download**: download any recording from your current seek position
- **Responsive layout**: wide mode shows stream + events side-by-side
- **Theming**: dark / light / auto, custom accent + background colour picker
- **Auto-rotate**: configurable interval rotation across cameras

## Installation via HACS

1. Open HACS → Frontend
2. Click ⋮ → Custom repositories
3. Add `https://github.com/QuadNL/frigate-modern-hass-card` as type **Dashboard**
4. Install "Frigate Modern Hass Card"
5. Hard-refresh your browser

> Once the repo is accepted in the HACS default store, you'll find it directly under HACS → Frontend without adding a custom repository.

## Manual Installation

Download `frigate-modern-hass-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/QuadNL/frigate-modern-hass-card/releases/latest) and place it in your `config/www/` folder.

Add to your Lovelace resources:
```yaml
url: /local/frigate-modern-hass-card.js
type: module
```

| `grid_layout` | string | `auto` | Named layout, see below. Sets the columns and tile sizes together |
| `grid_columns` | string/number | `auto` | Grid columns: `auto`, or `1`–`6`. Use `1` to stack cameras vertically |
| `stack_on_mobile` | boolean | `true` | Show one camera per row on a phone, whatever the layout says |
| `min_tile_width` | number | `200` | Narrowest a grid tile may get, in pixels, before the grid drops a column |
| `events_collapsed` | boolean | `false` | Start with the events panel hidden, giving the cameras the full width |
| `live_provider` | string | `hls` | Live view source: `hls` (Home Assistant stream) or `go2rtc` |
| `go2rtc_mode` | string | `mse` | go2rtc transport: `mse`, `webrtc`, or `auto` |
| `debug` | boolean | `false` | Log to the browser console why the live view picked what it picked |

### Grid layout

Easiest in the visual editor: **Grid layout** shows each arrangement as numbered
tiles, so you can see what you are picking. Choosing a layout sets both the column
count and the tile sizes. Layouts with fewer tiles than you have cameras are not
offered.

The number in front of each camera in the list is the tile it fills. To move a
camera, pick it in the tile where you want it: if it was already somewhere else,
the two cameras swap places.

In YAML the same thing is one line:

```yaml
grid_layout: 6-big   # one large camera with five smaller ones
```

| Layout | Arrangement |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Fits the number of cameras and the space available |
| `2-row` / `2-col` | Two cameras, stacked or side by side |
| `3-big` | One large plus two |
| `4` / `9` / `16` | Equal tiles |
| `6-big` | One large plus five |
| `8-big` | One large plus seven |
| `10-big` | Two large plus eight |

Layouts scale down: the columns reduce and the large tiles shrink with them, so
one configuration works on every screen.

On a phone the cameras stack, one per row, whatever the layout says. A grid on a
phone leaves every camera too small to see anything in. If you want the grid
there anyway, for two cameras side by side or a small overview:

```yaml
stack_on_mobile: false
```

With stacking off, `min_tile_width` decides how narrow a tile may get before a
column is dropped. Lower it for more columns on a small screen.

If none of them fit, build your own with `grid_columns` and a `span` per camera.
`span` takes a number for a square or `{cols: 2, rows: 1}` for a wide tile:

```yaml
grid_columns: 3
cameras:
  - entity: camera.front_door
    span: 2
  - entity: camera.garden
  - entity: camera.shed
```

### Events panel

On a wide screen the events list sits beside the cameras. The button next to the
fullscreen control folds it away, which gives the cameras the full width. To start
that way:

```yaml
events_collapsed: true
```

## Low-latency live view with go2rtc

By default the live view uses Home Assistant's own stream, which buffers several
seconds ahead. Frigate ships with go2rtc built in, and streaming through that
instead cuts the delay to roughly a second and is noticeably lighter on the
browser, which matters most in grid view, where every camera streams at once.

This is **opt-in**. To enable it, add one line to your card configuration:

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-modern-hass-card
camera_entity: camera.front_door
live_provider: go2rtc
```

Or in the visual editor: **Live view provider → go2rtc**.

No extra setup is needed. The card reaches go2rtc through the Frigate
integration's own proxy, so there is no separate URL or port to configure and it
keeps working remotely and in the companion apps. If go2rtc can't be reached,
the card falls back to the Home Assistant stream on its own. In grid view each
camera falls back independently, so one problematic camera won't take the others
down with it.

### Transport

| Value | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `mse` (default) | Everything runs over the proxied connection. Works locally, remotely and in the companion apps. |
| `webrtc` | Lowest possible latency, but connects straight to go2rtc's own port, which usually only resolves on the local network. |
| `auto` | Leaves the choice to the player, which tries WebRTC first. |

```yaml
live_provider: go2rtc
go2rtc_mode: webrtc   # only worth trying on a local network
```
